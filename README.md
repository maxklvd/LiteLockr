LiteLockr
=========
Utility for locking the desktop.

Example of using LiteLockr:

1. Open your browser
2. Make sure the browser window is active
3. Press Ctrl+Alt+B

The keyboard and mouse will now only work in the browser and will be locked in all other software. The selected program retains its full functionality - you can minimize and maximize your browser, open and close tabs, go to full screen, and so on.

When you no longer need the lock active, just press Ctrl+Alt+B again and the restrictions will be lifted.
